crystal-ball
============
This is basically a jump into Android development.  The only Android phone I have is one with a cracked screen,
but I don't have mac, so no iPhone development for me!

Crystal Ball is an app where if you shake it, it'll provide the user with an on-screen yes or no answer.  It's supposed
to replicate those Magic 8 Balls you probably had as a kid.
